					<p class="text-secondary">One-to-one support is all about you. It can be provided to anybody undertaking any form of performance, including athletes, coaches, or performers from other domains such as music and dance. The first session will be an intake session exploring your history, your goals and understanding of what support you would want to gain. We’ll work closely to unlock your potential, overcome mental barriers, and create a plan that fits your goals. Tailored guidance to help you think stronger, feel stronger, and perform at your best. This supportive partnership will help you not just overcome challenges but turn them into opportunities for growth and success.

					<p class="">This includes support being provided to your group or team while collaborating with an interdisciplinary team. The power of community is at the heart of these sessions — together, we’ll help each other grow, learn, and unlock new levels of performance and well-being. The focus of these sessions will be tailored according to the needs and demands of the team, but could include areas of stress and conflict, communication, team cohesion and ethos, or leadership development. </p>

					<p class="text-secondary">I offer interactive group workshops and engaging presentations. Whether working with athletes, teams, coaches, or fitness communities, these sessions combine practical techniques with real-world examples to make psychological skills easy to understand and apply. Each workshop or presentation focuses on building key areas such as confidence, focus, emotional control, and motivation, helping participants unlock their potential in sport and everyday life. Sessions are tailored to your group’s needs, creating an energetic and supportive environment where learning is active, relatable, and empowering. Whether you’re looking for a short talk, a half-day skills workshop, or a full-day program, the goal is to inspire lasting change and strengthen performance from the inside out.
