					<p class="text-secondary">As a young athlete, I always knew that physical training was important,
						but it wasn’t until I hit
						a point where motivation seemed to fade that I truly understood the power of the mind in sport
						and exercise. Running had always been my go-to outlet for clearing my head, building strength,
						and staying focused. But there came a time when I found myself dreading every run. I’d make
						excuses like “It’s too cold outside” or “I don’t have the energy today.” The motivation I once
						had seemed out of reach, and I couldn’t understand why.
					<p>
						This experience sparked my passion for sport and exercise psychology. I realized that the mind
						plays an equally crucial role in performance, whether you’re an elite athlete or someone just
						starting their fitness journey. Today, I am dedicated to helping others tap into the mental
						tools that can enhance performance, boost motivation, overcome challenges, and lead to their
						well-being. My approach combines practical psychological techniques with a deep understanding of
						how to help individuals unlock their full potential.</p>
					<p>
						Whether you’re an athlete seeking to improve mental performance or someone looking to find
						motivation to achieve your fitness goals, I’m here to guide you on that journey.</p>

					<p class="text-secondary">AMy approach is grounded in supporting the holistic development of my clients. While enhancing athletic performance is often the main goal, I place equal importance on promoting the well-being of the individual. To me, athletes are not just performers but complete people with unique experiences, and  I am committed to helping them thrive both on and off the field. A core element of my practice is Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy (REBT), which helps individuals recognise and challenge irrational beliefs that may be hindering their success. It is based on the belief that it’s not the events themselves, but our perceptions and interpretations of them that influence how we feel and behave. By shifting these beliefs to more rational, constructive thoughts, clients can experience lasting improvements in their performance and well-being.
					<p>
						At the heart of my approach is a commitment to fostering self-improvement, flexibility of thought, and logical thinking. Together, we can work to identify limiting beliefs, reframe them, and unlock the full potential of each client. My aim is to create an environment where clients can grow, not just in their athletic pursuits, but in all aspects of their lives. As a facilitator, I offer the support, tools, and insight needed to help clients take action toward their fitness and performance goals. My work extends beyond just sport and exercise, focusing on personal growth and the development of life skills that will help clients succeed both in and outside of the athletic world.</p>
