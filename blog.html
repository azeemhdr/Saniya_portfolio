							PHENOMENON</a>

					<p class="blog-content">
						You are running a marathon. Everything is going well, and all of a sudden it isn’t. You hit the
						19-mile mark and you start to feel immensely exhausted. Your pace slows down, and you feel like
						you
						are running into a wall. Your legs feel overly heavy, and you have to use every ounce of energy
						in
						your body to move towards the finishing line.
					</p>
					<p class="blog-content">
						This phenomenon is commonly called ‘hitting the wall’ and is experienced by marathoners usually
						around the 20-mile mark. It is caused by the depletion of your body’s energy sources, leading to
						a
						significant decrease in pace during the latter part of the race.
					</p>
					<p class="blog-content">
						Glycogen, a carbohydrate stored in your muscles, is the body’s main source of energy for
						long-distance running. The exhaustion experienced during this time (around the 20-mile mark) is
						attributed to the depletion of glycogen levels. This causes both mental as well as physical
						fatigue.
						Running a marathon takes an invariable amount of resources and energy. Towards the end of the
						marathon, the body’s energy resources start to deplete, and ‘hitting the wall’ is the way that
						the
						brain instructs the muscles to tense so that the body slows down.
					</p>
					<div class="blog-img mb-2 shadow"><a href="blog.html" class="blog-img-link"><img
								src="assets/images/site/blog2.png" alt="running a marathon" class="img-fluid rounded"></a></div>
					<p class="blog-content">How long does this phenomenon last? This is a common question when
						discussing
						the concept. Once a runner hits the wall, the feeling of exhaustion lasts for the remainder of
						the
						marathon. In other words, it is very difficult to reverse the effects, although there are a few
						things that can be done to recover. While a good nutrition regimen and an effective training
						program
						are crucial, it is also important to emphasise psychological interventions that can be
						introduced to
						avoid it in the first place.
					</p>
					<ol class="">
						<p class="blog-content fw-semibold">Here are two strategies that might be helpful in delaying or
							even preventing this experience:</p>

						<li class="">
							<h5 class="fw-semibold">Shifting your attentional focus</h5>
							<p class="blog-content">Shifting the attentional focus can help runners cope with hitting
								the
								wall. Attentional focus can be associative or dissociative thoughts. Associative
								thoughts
								include thoughts that are related to the task at hand, in this case, running. This
								includes
								thoughts related to pace and breath. On the other hand, dissociative thoughts include
								thoughts that are irrelevant to the task at hand, and include daydreams, focusing on the
								crowd or the situation around. Associative and dissociative thoughts can be used in
								different situations in different ways.</p>
							<p class="blog-content">
								Internal thoughts are the thoughts that are directed towards your internal mental and
								physical sensations. External thoughts are the thoughts are are directed outside of
								one’s
								body towards external cues. A combination of the above mentioned thoughts makes four
								broad
								dimensions of how attention can be shifted and focused. They are internal dissociative
								(ID),
								internal associative (IA), external dissociative (ED) and external associative (EA).
								Here
								are examples that can be followed to understand the concept:
							</p>
							<p class="blog-content">
								If you experience exhaustion or fatigue when running, and your mind is occupied with
								thoughts about the run (IA), shift your attention to an external situation like the path
								or
								road, the people around you, the buildings and other objects you pass (ED). By shifting
								your
								attention from the mental and physical sensations you experience to external cues, you
								distract yourself from the unpleasant feelings of fatigue and the negative thoughts that
								may
								accompany it.
							</p>
							<p class="blog-content">
								You can also focus your attention on internal aspects like your breath, pace (IA) or a
								random daydream (ID). This can be effective in overcoming the feeling of exhaustion that
								would have otherwise built over time.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5 class="fw-semibold">Engaging in helpful self-talk</h5>
							<p class="blog-content">Everyone engages in self-talk but keeping a few statements ready to
								use
								in challenging
								situations is an effective strategy. Helpful self-talk can be motivational and
								encouraging
								or instructional in nature, and can help avoid the intrusion of unhelpful thoughts that
								increase the likelihood of hitting the wall. Self-talk has a cognitive effect that
								increases
								our belief in our ability to perform the task at hand. To engage in helpful self-talk,
								the
								follow the steps below:
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p class="blog-content">Notice the thoughts and statements that enter your mind when
										you
										are running. Some of these may be unhelpful to you in that situation, whereas
										others
										might be helpful or even neutral. At the end of your run, write down the
										unhelpful
										thoughts in a notebook, in the same way as they crossed your mind. This
										increases
										awareness about the frequency of these thoughts and may also help you identify
										situations that trigger these unhelpful thoughts. Example: Saying “My muscles
										burn,
										I cannot do this anymore!” to yourself sometime after the 15-mile mark.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="blog-content">Next, reframe your unhelpful self-talk to make it more
										helpful
										in that situation. Example: “I have done this before, I have trained for this, I
										can
										do it”. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="blog-content">Use your prepared self-talk to cope with challenging
										situations
										throughout your run.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="blog-content">Finally, remember that practice is key. Just as you
										regularly
										train yourself physically and technically, include your new mental strategy in
										every
										training session and run.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="blog-content">To conclude, while running a marathon, the body requires a number of
						resources,
						both physiological and psychological. Runners that train all aspects responsible for performance
						are
						less likely to experience this phenomenon and are in a better position to cope with these
						challenges
						along the way.
